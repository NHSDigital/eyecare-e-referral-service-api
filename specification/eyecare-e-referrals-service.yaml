    ## Overview

    Use this API standard to pass details of a new referral from an Optometry Patient Management System (Optometry PMS) to an Eyecare electronic Referral system (EeRS).
    
    The API standard supports sending key referral information (including the GOS18 data items) from an optometrist to NHS services via an EeRS. This is important for engaging optometrists in digital referrals into the NHS, and eliminate double-keying of information documented as part of a sight test or optical consultation.

    Each NHS region will procure an EeRS system from the [Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for Electronic Eyecare Referral Systems (EeRS)](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/procurement-frameworks/dynamic-purchasing-system-electronic-eyecare-referral-systems/). 
    Each EeRS system receives referrals using this API standard and provides its own endpoint for this service.
    
    This API standard is a published specification only. Therefore you, as an Optometry PMS developer, implement and integrate it directly with each EeRS, not via our services. Therefore, the sending Optometry PMS system needs to link to each EeRS eyecare e-referral endpoint that conforms to the API standard.  
    
    ### Building the API standard into an Optometry PMS
    
    Use the following steps to implement the API standard as a sending Optometry PMS to a specific EeRS:

    1. Identify the data fields in your system that correspond to the data fields in the specification.
    2. Ask the EeRS supplier to provide their API endpoint.
    3. Ask the EeRS supplier you are integrating with to provide a system-to-system API key. 
    4. Develop your system to connect to the API and send the API key with the data payload to that EeRS endpoint. 
    5. Design a way of initiating the referral process from the Optometry PMS – ideally using a “refer via EeRS” button in the right part of the workflow in your PMS system
    6. Test that referral process is working from your Optomotry PMS to the endpoint with the EeRS, and check with a clinician that the right data fields are coming across inside the EeRS system. 

    #### Optometry PMS sender guidance

    If there is no value in your Optometry PMS for a non-mandatory nullable field do either one of the following:
      - exlcude that field from the JSON
      - use JSON NULL to represent an empty field rather than empty string. 

    #### EeRS provider guidance

    Any non-mandatory field will either be included as JSON null or not included at all from the sending Optometry PMS system. When saving a new referral initialise these fields to null in your system.

    ## Who can use this API

    This API standard can be provided by any EeRS as procured regionally.  It can be used by any Optometry PMS to allow an Optometrist to send a referral into a specific EeRS system. Integrated Care Systems may require each Optometry system in use in their area to link to their specific EeRS system.
    
    ## API status and roadmap

    This API standard is in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
      * it is available for production use
      * we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give an advance notice
    
    To suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=eyecare-e-referral-api&deleted=0#controls).

    If you have any other queries, please contact us at mailto:bookingandreferrals@nhs.net.
    
    ### Version control

    We use HTTP headers to allow you to specify the API version you want to call.

    In general, once an API is stable (meaning it has exited beta) we avoid making any breaking changes. That means we might add new data fields or add new valid values to code sets, but we won't remove any mandatory fields or change the semantic meaning of any existing fields or code sets.

    If we ever do need to make breaking changes to a stable API, we will continue to use HTTP headers to allow you to specify the API version you want to call. We'll do this in a backwards-compatible way.

    This spec version:            1.0.0

    ## Technology

    This API standard uses RESTful technology, as described in our guidance [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).
    
    ## Network access
    
    EeRS supplier API endpoints that conform to this API standard are available on the internet.

    ## Security and authorisation
    
    All communications must be encrypted using HTTP(S).

    Each EeRS endpoint must be secured via an API key included in the HTTP header. Note that we recommend the use of an 128-bit API key as a minimum.
    Liaise with the EeRS supplier you are integrating with, to get an API key for their endpoint configuration.

    ## Onboarding

    Liaise with NHSX for onboarding your service into live operation. Please contact NHSX at mailto:digital.podac@nhsx.nhs.uk.

         ### Create a new referral in the EeRS

          **Step 1**: The cinician user decides to create a referral and clicks “refer via EeRS” or similar on the Optometry PMS system

          **Step 2**: Optometry PMS gathers the data payload to send via the API
          
          **Step 3**: Optometry PMS identifies the EeRS supplier API to call based on the optometry practice where the practitioner has clicked ‘create EeRS referral’
          
          **Step 4**: Optometry PMS initiates API by sending API key to the EeRS in question with the data payload
          
          **Step 5**: EeRS provides a response 201 with a URL - or an error message
          
         ### Complete the referral in the EeRS 

          **Step 1**: Optometry PMS launches the URL for the user in a browser
          
          **Step 2**: The user can now see the data rendered in the EeRS, and can complete the referral.
          
          **Step 3**: The user completes the referral using the EeRS.

        A status update can be initiated by a clinician or admin, or set to be initiated automatically for all referrals as desired.

          **Step 1**: PMS system requests a status check to a specific referral ID using the same API key as for the referral

          **Step 2**: EeRS supplier provides response 200 with the status - or an error message
