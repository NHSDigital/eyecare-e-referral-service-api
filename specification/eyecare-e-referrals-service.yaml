    ## Overview

    Use this API standard to pass details of a new referral from an Optometry Patient Management System (Optometry PMS) to an Eyecare e-referral system (EeRS).
    
    The goal of the API standard is to pre-populate clinical, user and patient information from an Optometry PMS to an EeRS. 

    The API standard supports auto-population of GOS18 and associated referral data from the Optomoetry PMS. This is important for engaging optometrists in digital referrals into the NHS, and eliminate double-keying of information documented as part of a sight test or optical consultation.
    
    Each NHS region will procure an EeRS system from the [Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for Electronic Eyecare Referral Systems (EeRS)](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/procurement-frameworks/dynamic-purchasing-system-electronic-eyecare-referral-systems/). 
    Each EeRS system receives referrals using this API standard and provides its own endpoint for this service.
    
    This API standard is a published specification only. Therefore you, as an Optometry PMS developer, implement and integrate it directly with each EeRS, not via our services. Therefore, the sending Optometry PMS system needs to link to each EeRS eyecare e-referral endpoint that conforms to the API standard.  
    The details on the EeRS suppliers and their endpoints is here [insert link to NHSX site here] 
    
    You can:
    - transfer key clinical, patient and practitioner information associated with making a referral to NHS health services via an EeRS
    - auto-populate GOS18 and associated referral data from the Optometry PMS


    ## Who can use this API

    This API standard can be used by any Optometry PMS to allow an Optometrist to send a referral into a specific EeRS system. Integrated Care Systems require each Optometry system in use in their area to link to their specific EeRS system.

    ## API status and roadmap

    This API standard is in [Beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
      * it is available for production use
      * we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give an advance notice

    To suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=eyecare-e-referral-api&deleted=0#controls).

    If you have any other queries, please contact us at bookingandreferrals@nhs.net.

    ## Technology

    This API standard uses HTTP POST to submit data.
    
    ## Network access
    
    EeRS supplier API endpoints that conform to this API standard are available on the internet.

    ## Security and authorisation
    
    Each EeRS endpoint must be secured via an API key. Note that we recommend the use of an 128-bit API key as a minimum.
    Liaise with the EeRS supplier you are integrating with, to get an API key for their endpoint configuration.

    ## Building the API standard into an Optometry PMS
    
    Use the following steps to implement the API as a sending Optometry PMS to a specific EeRS:

    1. Identify the data fields in your system that correspond to the data fields in the specification.
    2. Ask the EeRS supplier to provide their API endpoint.
    3. Ask the EeRS supplier you are integrating with to provide a system-to-system API key. 
    4. Develop your system to connect to the API and send the API key with the data payload to that EeRS endpoint. 
    5. Design a way of initiating the referral process from the Optometry PMS – ideally using a “refer via EeRS” button in the right part of the workflow in your PMS system
    6. Test that referral process is working from your Optomotry PMS to the endpoint with the EeRS, and check with a clinician that the right data fields are coming across inside the EeRS system. 

    ## Onboarding
    
    Liaise with NHSX for onboarding your service into live operation.

         ### Create a new referral in the EeRS system

          **Step 1**: Clinician decides to launch a referral and clicks “refer via EeRS” or similar on the PMS system
          - PMS system gathers the data payload to send via the API
          - PMS system identifies the EeRS supplier API to call based on the optom practice where the practitioner has clicked ‘launch EeRS referral’
          - PMS system initiates API by sending API key to the digital referrals (EeRS) supplier in question with the data payload
          - Digital referrals supplier provides a response 201 with a URL - or an error message
          - PMS system launches the URL for the user

          **Step 2**: The user can now see the data rendered in the digital referrals system on their browser, and can complete the referral.\
          **Step 3**: The user sends and/or saves the referral using the digital referrals system.

        ### Returns the status of the referral with the given ID

        A status update can be initiated by a clinician or admin, or set to be initiated automatically for all referrals as desired.
          - PMS system requests a status check to a specific referral ID using the same API key as for the referral
          - EeRS supplier provides response
          - PMS system exposes the URL associated with the referral from the original API call associated with that referral, so that the user can receive a prompt to complete their referral in the EeRS system without additional manual authentication.
